todo: 

* concurrent runs.
* command line animations. [Pretty command line / console output on Unix in Python and Go Lang](http://www.darkcoding.net/software/pretty-command-line-console-output-on-unix-in-python-and-go-lang/)
* refactor PLA and other functions into separate packages.

thoughts:

It should be better to devide the packages based on models and methods.
Here is how the topics are presentes in the learning from data web page:
[topics](http://work.caltech.edu/library/)

models:

* linear classification: PLA
* linear regression
* logistic regression
* non linear transformation
* neural networks
* support vector machines
* nearest neighbors


methods:
* regularization
* validation
